				The following is a list of guidelines by which I live my day to day life.

				<h4>Always Pushing</h4>
				<div>
					Its important to keep learning new things and extending myself. 
					<ul>
						<li>
							Programming - always be working on a project, and learning new things - this includes frameworks, tools and design principals. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Langauges - I try to use Japanese every day. When I don't know a word, I write it down and try to use it again as soon as possible. I would also like to study other languages in the future, like Korean.
						</li>
						<li>
							Never be satisfied - being content with what I have means I won't be pushing myself to improve and learn. I want to never be content, and always aiming higher.
						</li>
						<li>
							Seek new experiences - so far I have lived in Australia and Japan, and experienced two vastly different cultures. I want to live in other places and experience and learn more. Staying in one place too long could make me too comfortable, and slow my progress.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<h4>Minimal Luggage</h4>
				<div>
					As much as possible, I avoid accumlating physical possessions, unless they provide great value to my life. For example:
					<ul>
						<li>Books - instead of purchasing physical copies, I buy an eBook. When I'm done with it, it doesn't sit around taking up space, and I can easily share it with someone or keep a backup copy.
						</li>
						<li>
							Clothes - only keep a small number of clothes, ideally enough for a week. Keep clothes only used on certain occasionals to a minimum - for example, I only need one vest, since I rarely wear it anyway. When buying a new piece of clothing, try to get rid of one of the same kind.
						</li>
						<li>
							Furniture - try not to own too much, or make sure it's light, and easy to sell or give away. Ideally, try to rent or live in already furnished locations. I should be able to pack and move everything without trouble, in case a great opportunity arises.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Optimizing Time</h4>
					<div>
						Daily life is full of mundane activities. Although computers have automated a lot of the boring ones, a lot of others still exist. Mundane activities are activties that don't make you a better person, or help you to learn and grow.
						<ul>
							<li>
								Washing and Cleaning - By minimizing the amount of things in my room, cleaning can be done in a smaller amount of time. I hang all my clothes, so I don't have to waste time ironing and folding.
							</li>
							<li>
								Cooking - I don't like cooking, but it's important to be healthy. I try to prepare food that doesn't take long to make and is healthy, like salads and raw fish.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h4>Communication and Relationships</h4>
				<div>
					As exciting as programming, studying and training are, the most valuable skill is the ability to communicate. 
					<ul>
						<li>
							Speaking - I will strive to improve at public speaking, and at concisely and clearly expressing myself.
						</li>
						<li>
							People - I appreciate and treasure the people around me, like my family, friends, and Lily.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
